As a logged-in user, I want to be able to save my recipes in the app. The user will be able to upload new recipes. When everything goes right, the user would upload a link from Spooncular.com and the web app would parse the recipe to find the ingredients needed. When everything goes wrong, if a user were to upload a link to a recipe from Spooncular.com, the web app is unable to properly parse to find the ingredients listed.  

As a logged-in user, I want to search for specific ingredients on multiple platforms at once. The user will access the web app and be able to select the ingredients filtered by the web app. When everything goes right, the top 3 rated ingredients would be displayed. When the top 3 rated ingredients are displayed, the user would have the option to choose which ingredient they would like to order. If something goes wrong, then less than 3 rated ingredients would be displayed. A message would appear indicating tha that ingredient is out of stock or not available in that platform.

As a logged-in user, I want to be able to be directed to the specific website with ingredients already in cart, or be connected to direct ingredient links. Once clicking on the directed cart link, it will take users to the cart into their accounts. The payments will be processed on the third party website chosen by the user.

As a logged-in user, I want to be able to filter which platforms the web app searches for ingredients on. Users will be able to connect their accounts directly through the web app. This will be implemented with SSO in the backend. When everything goes right, the userâ€™s account would be properly linked such that ingredients added in the web app will be automatically added to the cart of a platform of their choice. 

As a logged-in user, I want to be able to track past recipes in the app. The user will be able to view a history of recipes previously imported into the web app. When everything goes right, the web app will display the history of past recipes in a list format. When everything goes wrong, the previously imported recipes would not be displayed.
