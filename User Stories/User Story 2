As a logged-in user, I want to search for specific ingredients on multiple platforms at once. The user will access the web app and be able to select the ingredients filtered by the web app. When everything goes right, the top 3 rated ingredients would be displayed. When the top 3 rated ingredients are displayed, the user would have the option to choose which ingredient they would like to order. If something goes wrong, then less than 3 rated ingredients would be displayed. A message would appear indicating tha that ingredient is out of stock or not available in that platform.
