As a logged-in user, I want to be able to save my recipes in the app. The user will be able to upload new recipes. When everything goes right, the user would upload a link from Spooncular.com and the web app would parse the recipe to find the ingredients needed. When everything goes wrong, if a user were to upload a link to a recipe from Spooncular.com, the web app is able to properly parse to find the ingredients listed.
