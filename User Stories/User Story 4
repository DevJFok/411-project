As a logged-in user, I want to be able to filter which platforms the web app searches for ingredients on. Users will be able to connect their accounts directly through the web app. This will be implemented with SSO in the backend. When everything goes right, the userâ€™s account would be properly linked such that ingredients added in the web app will be automatically added to the cart of a platform of their choice.
